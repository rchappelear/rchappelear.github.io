    <p>Rebecca Chappelear is a photographic artist based in Wilmington, North Carolina. She focuses her practice on the created, or "farmed", photograph, often utilizing a narrative theme in each body of work. By selecting this style of image-making she is able to use her work to examine the margin between reality and construction.
    <p>She obtained her Master of Fine Arts in Photography and Integrated Media from Lesley University's College of Art and Design, and has exhibited her work in Massachusetts, Washington DC, Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia.</p>
