            <p>The documentation of my surroundings is an act which has been dear to me ever since I was first introduced to travel at a young age. This ever-evolving series of work encapsulates not a place itself, as each given location already has its own archive of photographic evidence, but a cropped point of view of my own interpretation of each moment.</p>
